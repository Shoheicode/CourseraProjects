# Minimum Spanning Trees

## Description:
In this Assignment/section, I studied the minimum spanning tree problem. I learned two elegant greedy algorithms for this problem: the first one is due to Kruskal and uses the disjoint sets data structure, the second one is due to Prim and uses the priority queue data structure. 

In the programming assignment for this module, I computed an optimal way of building roads between cities and an optimal way of partitioning a given set of objects into clusters (a fundamental problem in data mining).

## Learning Objectives
- Explain what a spanning tree is
- Describe algorithms for computing minimum spanning trees
- Create an efficient program for clustering
