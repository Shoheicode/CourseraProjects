# Maximum Pairwise Product
## Maximum Pairwise Product Problem
Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers.
### Input: 
An integer n and a sequence of n non-negative integers.
### Output: 
The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence.
