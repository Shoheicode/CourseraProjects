# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization

## Description:

In these Coursera Projects, I am solving a wide variety of problems and issues using an array of different computer science concepts and data structures and algorithims.

Donald Knuth once said, "I don’t understand things unless I try to program them." This idea is at the heart of this course on algorithms, where we believe the best way to learn is by coding. While many excellent books and online courses introduce algorithmic concepts, they often don’t teach you how to implement them—a crucial skill for job interviews. I learned from this course taught by top experts from UCSD and a former Google engineer these concepts. Unlike most courses that focus only on theory, the program combines theory with practical applications and software engineering. I solved nearly 100 coding problems, making it one of the most hands-on algorithm courses available. They designed these challenges to replace the typical multiple-choice questions found in many MOOCs, putting a strong emphasis on real-world problem-solving.

During the completion of this course, I recieved multiple certificates along with the projects that I completed for the course. It was super informative and really insightful on the information provided.
