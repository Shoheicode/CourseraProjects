# Programming Assignment 3: Greedy Algorithm

## Description:

## What is a Greedy Algorithm?
In order to make a Greedy Algorithm, you must have a Greedy Strategy.

A Greedy Strategy is basically:
- Make some greedy choice
- Reduce to a smaller problem (aka subproblem)
- Iterate

Subproblems are defined as:
A similar problem of smaller size.

Safe Move:
A greedy choice is called safe move if there is an optimal solution consistent with this first move.
